During the past couple of months, there have been two video games I've been looking forward to playing for a long time. These two titles are **Hollow Knight: Silksong** and **Pokémon Legends: Z-A**. They are vastly different games in many ways: they belong to two completely different genres, they play differently, and they were developed by different people. And yet, I cannot help but draw parallels between the way these two games were received by the wider public. 

During the first few days after the release of these two titles, reviews poured in and players were polarized about their quality. Many praised Silksong for how ambitious it was and the amount of content it offered, but there were also many people that believed it *pale*d in comparison to the original Hollow Knight. Despite it now sitting at a "Very Positive" rating on Steam, the game was seen as "Mixed" a few days after it came out. Reviews ranged from extremely positive to extremely negative, and the points mentioned in some of these reviews directly contradicted each other. As time has passed, public opinion about the game has mellowed out and players have moved on to different titles. However, I find that Pokémon Legends Z-A is currently going through the exact same thing. The vastly different reviews, the blind hate *and* the blind love. These two video games are not the only ones experiencing this phenomenon: an explosion of polarized discussion with no middle ground during the release of the game, and silence once the hype dies down. However, they are the games that made me ask myself...

## What's the point of video game reviews?

Gaming is inherently subjective. Video games are what economics defines as an **experience good**. You can't fully evaluate a video game until you actually experience it firsthand. Observing them or reading a review can't fully capture the enjoyment of playing the game, since the medium is completely different: you cannot translate immersion, or interaction with the gameplay elements through something that does not allow for interaction. Someone could describe the taste of coffee to me, and I could attempt to predict whether I'll like it or not through comparisons with previous experiences, but I'll only know if I like it or not once I actually experience it for myself.

Let us say that an experience good is made of a list of **experienceable elements** (E). Each of these elements, upon being experienced, produces a sentiment within the person. For example:
- E1 --> Positive sentiment.
- E2 --> Negative sentiment.
- E3 --> Mixed sentiment.

These experienceable elements (E) can only be judged after being experienced. They are formed *post hoc*.

A review of an experienced good, such as a video game, can follow two different directions. It can either present the experienceable elements with a pre-assigned judgment, or it can simply present that these elements exist without any judgment in regard to the quality of the experienced good. 

The first of these two is the most popular way of reviewing video games. These reviews present the experienceable elements alongside a pre-assigned sentiment. The reviewer takes the different elements from the game and tells you whether these elements are good or bad, fun or boring, rewarding or tedious. These judgments may be something entirely subjective, or they may be rooted in an attempt at finding logic in the design of the game. While the second of these approaches may feel objective, and it sometimes may even be presented as such, the reality is that there are players that find fun in elements that are sometimes associated with bad game design: grinding and excessive difficulty that requires trial and error are perfect examples. These judgments are not inherent to the games and cannot be obtained *a priori*. They are the product of a relationship between a player and the game: between each of the elements and the sentiment it produced in that individual.

This means that every review, no matter how well-argued or logically structured (yes, even the five-hour-long video essays are subjective), is a personal expression of *someone's experience* and not of the *quality of the game*. What reviews are ultimately communicating is the reviewer's emotional mapping. Game design theory can explain *how* something works, but it can't dictate how it will *feel* to the player. This is a well-studied field, and there are logical elements that are known to be more appealing because of psychology and other aspects of human nature. But to believe in the infallible nature of game design theory is simply a fallacy; enjoyment can't be standardized.

The type of "review" that simply presents the experienceable elements without judgment is essentially what trailers and promotional materials do. A trailer tells you that the game features certain elements, but it doesn't tell you how those things will feel to you. Trailers might produce a certain sentiment in you, but it is purely *predictive* in nature (just like the coffee example from earlier). This sentimental response is based on *expectation* and *comparison from previous experiences*. While this sentiment might help you decide whether you'll purchase a game or not, it cannot be confused for an actual experience of the game.

That isn't to say you have to purchase every video game ever made, but rather that this *expectation* also does not reflect the game's quality.

Of course, there are aspects of a video game that can be discussed more objectively. Performance issues, glitches are flaws by definition. These are not experienceable elements in themselves, as they are not game design elements, but rather flaws in the medium those elements are presented in. In other words, they can be seen as obstacles that prevent the player from accessing the intended experience. It is good to report these so that consumers know they exist for the sake of transparency. However, even among these issues, there exists a degree of subjectivity. The degree to which these obstacles actually hurt the player experience depends on the player themselves.

The problem arises when people conflate these technical issues with gameplay design choices. Some things like grinding, repetition, or high difficulty are often treated as "objective flaws" when they are, in truth, subjective, experienceable elements. This was the case, for example, in the Silksong debate I discussed earlier.

Once we accept all of this, we're left with a simple truth: reviews are deeply personal **reflections**, not objective evaluations that mean anything to the consumer of said review. Yet, despite this, we still read and write reviews. Why?

## What's the point of video game reviews?

The answer is rooted in social behavior.

Matthew Philp and Marcelo Vinhal wrote an article called *"How reviews influence product usage post-purchase: An examination of video game playtime"* that explores deeply interesting topics when it comes to how negative reviews affect our opinions about video games. The conclusion of this article's study is fascinating: regardless of whether someone enjoyed the game or not, there is a positive relationship between the decrease of playtime and negative reviews of a game. Even when someone enjoys a game, they might play it less because of concerns with their own image. This is also tied with the fact that people are less likely to talk positively about games they like (and more likely to talk negatively) if there is a widespread negative opinion of said game to avoid something called "*consumer incompetence*". Consumer incompetence is the belief that one is incompetent for making a certain purchase, leading to feelings of shame.

However, other studies, such as "The Effect of YouTube Reviews on Video Game Sales" by Feray Adiguzel, also show a positive relation between reviews and video game sales, even when those reviews are negative.

This leads me to, perhaps, a rather obvious conclusion. Video game reviews serve the purpose of validating people's opinions so they can prove that they are not *incompetent consumers*. As Matthew Philp and Marcelo Vinhal expose, though, this fear of being perceived as incompetent leads people to purchase fewer preferred products or even lie to avoid creating undesirable impressions. In other words, video game reviews are inherently **parasocial**. The attempt at judging whether a game is good or bad has less to do with the game itself and more to do with being a part of a group through social conformity.

We have already shown how video game reviews only hold meaning for the individual that wrote them, as they are **reflective** by nature. The game itself cannot be good or bad in a vacuum, so a review is meaningless to anyone but the person themselves. Reading others' reviews, or receiving criticism for our review, should not impact our own experience of a game, but the studies we have quoted seem to show that they do.

The problem is not video game reviews; it is the fact that they are mistaken for something they're not. They should be treated as a reflective piece, not as an objective judgment of a game. And our reflection should not dictate how others should reflect on the game either. We should talk about games more responsively.

So, what's the point of video game reviews?

Maybe there isn't one. Maybe they're just another experienceable element. Discussion about people's reflections on any form of art is, after all, part of art. Just like this pretentious article I just wrote.

... Fuck if I know lol.
