# SUBJECT #001 - Pokémon Red, Blue and Yellow

I don't think Pokémon Red, Blue and Yellow need an introduction. Pokémon is the most profitable and recognizable franchise in the world, and these games served as the introduction to this popular series of RPGs. Pokémon Red and Green were released February 27, 1996 in Japan. These RPGs received an updated version, Pokémon Blue, which was later released worldwide in 1998 (split into two versions, Red and Blue). They quickly became the best-selling games for the Game Boy, and are still the best-selling Pokémon games in general when when combining its multiple releases and re-releases.

Pokémon Red and Blue were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo. Its development was full of issues and delays, which are too numerous and lengthy to talk about here. They are RPGs with an incredible degree of replayability, even if their gameplay is considered to be pretty outdated today. Through this LP, I want to explore every aspect of these games while taking notes of everything I encounter along the way. I have always been a fan of the Pokémon franchise, but I've always played them pretty superficially. With this LP, I hope to be able to share my love for this series while maybe finding new things to appreciate!

I'll include screenshots, links to the OST of the game and any flavor text I find important. And, because I can and this is MY log (heh), I'll also try to spice it up by actually pretending to be the character I'm playing as. It is a **role-playing** game, after all!

... I promise it'll be pretty minimal. My objective is to help you appreciate these games more, not make you cringe and click away.
